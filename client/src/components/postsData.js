      `Participating in international hackathons has always been a dream of mine â€” and this time, it came true in a big way. I had the chance to travel to France and attend two incredible events: ETHGlobal Cannes and the Chiliz Hackathon Paris. Here's a recap of this unforgettable journey, which I proudly called "Road to France".`,
      `Even though I'm already experienced with hackathons, nothing could've prepared me for what I experienced in Cannes. Right from the start, I was thrilled to be selected among the Top 100 hackers to receive support from the Ethereum Foundation, which granted me a spot in a Hacker House â€” something I'm extremely grateful for.`,
      `My team included Kethlen Martins and Davi Abreu, both Inteli students and incredibly talented people. Together, we built Mosaic3, a project we were proud to present and develop throughout the weekend.`,
      `The event was highly competitive, with amazing projects and an inspiring atmosphere. There was even a fireworks show on the final night! Cannes was absolutely stunning, and being part of such a vibrant environment was truly magical.`,
      `I was also glad to meet other incredible Brazilians there, such as:`,
      `â€¢ Henrique Marlon (Inteli)`,
      `â€¢ Emanuele Morais (Inteli)`,
      `â€¢ Solange Gueiros (Chainlink Developer)`,
      `â€¦along with many others who made the experience even more special.`,
      `Although we didn't win any track at ETHGlobal Cannes, the experience alone made it all worth it. It was truly unforgettable.`,
      `After a few days exploring France, my team and I headed to Paris for the Chiliz Hackathon. This time, we were more prepared, more organized, and brought a more polished idea. We built Trbe, a project we carefully planned and pitched with confidence.`,
      `In Paris, we met more amazing Brazilians, including:`,
      `â€¢ JoÃ£o Rubens Belluzzo Neto (Impacta)`,
      `â€¢ Lucas Bispo de Oliveira (Head of Education at NearX)`,
      `â€¢ Marina Fuzeti (Senior PR Manager at Chiliz)`,
      `Despite not winning, we left with a strong sense of progress. I improved so much as a developer and teammate. These global hackathons keep pushing me forward, sharpening my skills and expanding my vision.`,
      `The Road to France was more than just a trip. It was the realization of a dream, a milestone in my personal and professional journey. I'm deeply thankful to everyone who was part of it â€” friends, mentors, organizers, sponsors, and the entire community.`,
      `If there's one thing I've learned, it's that the real prize isn't always the trophy â€” it's in the growth, connections, and experiences along the way.`,
      `Can't wait for the next adventure. ðŸš€ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·`

      `I've been thinking about starting a blog because many of my projects lack a proper space for discussion. I want to share my ideas more broadly, and although blogging might seem a bit old-fashioned, it feels like the perfect medium for me. I won't deny that a big inspiration behind this idea came from someone I deeply admireâ€”Vitalik Buterin, who also has a blog. But beyond that, there are other reasons driving this decision.`,
      `For example, a blog offers much more room for expression compared to platforms like Twitter. Here, I'll be able to dive deeper into my thoughts on new technologies and share my perspectives on them. When my team and I created the SBTn technology, I wasn't able to fully discuss its impact or promote it beyond the hackathon where it was developed. A blog seems like the perfect place for that.`,
      `I also see this as an opportunity to explore a wide range of topics that I've always wanted to talk aboutâ€”AI, blockchain, my vision for the future of Web 3.0, algorithms, and even personal experiences. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to finally have a space to share all of this. That's why I decided to create this blog.`
